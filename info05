Scopes 
it's the context where variables may be  globally or locally in .
const city = 'New York City'; // global variable

const logCitySkyline = () => {
  let skyscraper = 'Empire State Building'; // local variable 
  return 'The stars over the ' + skyscraper + ' in ' + city;
};
console.log(logCitySkyline(city)) 
--- 
ex; on global scope
const satellite= 'The Moon'; // this is global
const galaxy= 'The Milky Way';//  -------
const stars='North Star';     // ---------

const callMyNightSky=()=>{
return 'Night Sky: ' + satellite + ', ' + stars + ', and ' + galaxy;

}
console.log(callMyNightSky())
ex on local scope
 const logVisibleLightWaves=()=>{
  const lightWaves='Moonlight';
  console.log(lightWaves);
 }
 
 logVisibleLightWaves()
---
this is how scope pollution works ( you named two variable with the same name one of them local and the other global once you
log the local the global will reassign by the local and make pollution into the code .
const satellite = 'The Moon';
const galaxy = 'The Milky Way';
let stars = 'North Star';

const callMyNightSky = () => {
   stars= 'Sirius';
	return 'Night Sky: ' + satellite + ', ' + stars + ', ' + galaxy;
};

console.log(callMyNightSky());
console.log(stars);  // Sirius is now inside the global stars
--
this is how to make scope precise to avoid any pollution  using ; block scope.
const logVisibleLightWaves = () => {
  let lightWaves = 'Moonlight';
	let region = 'The Arctic';
  // Add if statement here:
  if (region==="The Arctic"){
    let lightWaves='Northern Lights';   // here we add new value the same variable in the function above but notice they are isolated from each other
    
    console.log(lightWaves)   // the output here   will be for the second function as log inside it's scope
  
  }
  console.log(lightWaves); // the output here will be for the first function as we log inside it's scope
};

logVisibleLightWaves();
notes;
scopes ; are the context in which variables located in
global scopes -> context where it's variables are accessible through the whole program
local scopes -> context where it's variables are accessible through the block scope or the local scope
Global namespace -> space in our program which contain global variables;
