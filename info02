2. let  (new keyboard that made after ES6 version of Js)

let variablename ; 
console.log(variablename)   ->  variablename = undefined

=> value here into this variable can't be alert or changes .
some assignment operators should be know
1. +=

we can use (+) for concatenate two strings;
 let myPet = 'armadillo';
console.log('I own a pet ' + myPet + '.'); 
// Output: 'I own a pet armadillo.'
to make an interpolation for your text inside string  
use; ${text}  
console.log(${text} );
---
we use ; typeof behine the variable to determine it's type
console.log(typeof variablename)
