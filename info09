.forEach()
Preview: Docs Loops over a given array, passing each item in the array into the callback function provided.
is used to execute the same code on every element in an array, but does not change the array and returns undefined


const artists = ['Picasso', 'Kahlo', 'Matisse', 'Utamaro'];

artists.forEach(artist => {
  console.log(artist + ' is one of my favorite artists.');
});

const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

const squareNumbers = numbers.map(number => {
  return number * number;
});

console.log(squareNumbers);

const things = ['desk', 'chair', 5, 'backpack', 3.14, 100];

const onlyNumbers = things.filter(thing => {
  return typeof thing === 'number';
});

console.log(onlyNumbers);

this is how forEach works;
const fruits = ['mango', 'papaya', 'pineapple', 'apple'];

// Iterate over fruits below
fruits.forEach(fruit =>{
  console.log( `I want to eat a ${fruit}.`)
})
ouput;
Output-only Terminal
Output:

I want to eat a mango.
I want to eat a papaya.
I want to eat a pineapple.
I want to eat a apple.

1.Use .map() to create a new array that contains the first character of each string in the animals array. Save the new array to a const variable named secretMessage.
Checkpoint 2 Passed

2.Use .map() to divide all the numbers in bigNumbers by 100. Save the returned values to a variable declared with const called smallNumbers.
solution;

const animals = ['Hen', 'elephant', 'llama', 'leopard', 'ostrich', 'Whale', 'octopus', 'rabbit', 'lion', 'dog'];

// Create the secretMessage array below
const secretMessage= animals.map(char=>{
  return char[0] ;
})

console.log(secretMessage.join(''));

const bigNumbers = [100, 200, 300, 400, 500];

// Create the smallNumbers array below

const smallNumbers=bigNumbers.map(num=>{
  return num/100;
})

how to use .filter 
Call the .filter() method on randomNumbers to return values that are less than 250. Save them to a new array called smallNumbers, declared with const.
Checkpoint 2 Passed

2.

Now let’s work with an array of strings. Invoke .filter() on the favoriteWords array to return elements that have more than 7 characters. Save the returned array to a const variable named longFavoriteWords.
const randomNumbers = [375, 200, 3.14, 7, 13, 852];

// Call .filter() on randomNumbers below
const randomNumbers = [375, 200, 3.14, 7, 13, 852];

// Call .filter() on randomNumbers below
const smallNumbers=randomNumbers.filter(num=>{
  if (num<250){
    return num;
  }
})
console.log(smallNumbers)
const favoriteWords = ['nostalgia', 'hyperbole', 'fervent', 'esoteric', 'serene'];


const longFavoriteWords= favoriteWords.filter(string=>{
  return string.length>7;
})
console.log(longFavoriteWords)
solution;
Output-only Terminal
Output:

[ 200, 3.14, 7, 13 ]
[ 'nostalgia', 'hyperbole', 'esoteric' ]

for .findindex() this function make iteration over the array + return the index of element you want
1.
if it didn't find any element -> will return -1 


Invoke .findIndex() on the animals array to find the index of the element that has the value 'elephant' and save the returned value to a const variable named foundAnimal.
Checkpoint 2 Passed

2.

Let’s see if we can find the index of the first animal that starts with the letter 's'.

Call .findIndex() on the animals array and return the index of the first element that starts with 's'. Assign the returned value to a const variable named startsWithS.

solution;
const animals = ['hippo', 'tiger', 'lion', 'seal', 'cheetah', 'monkey', 'salamander', 'elephant'];

const foundAnimal=animals.findIndex(ani=>
{
  return ani==='elephant';
})
// console.log(foundAnimal)
const startsWithS=animals.findIndex(ani=>{
  return ani[0]==='s';
})
console.log(foundAnimal)
console.log(startsWithS)
output;
Output-only Terminal
Output:

.reduce()  -> this method reduce the array into single element
1.

Let’s practice calling .reduce() and using console.log() to check the values as .reduce() iterates through the array.

In main.js, there is an array of numbers, newNumbers.

To start, declare a new variable named newSum using the const keyword. Assign to newSum the value of calling .reduce() on newNumbers. You don’t need to provide any arguments to .reduce() yet.

You’ll see a TypeError: undefined is not a function in the console after this step — we’ll fix this by adding a callback function in the next step!
Checkpoint 2 Passed

2.

Provide .reduce with an argument of a callback function. The callback function should have two parameters, accumulator and currentValue, in that order. Use either a function expression or an arrow function.
Checkpoint 3 Passed

3.

To check the value being used as we iterate through the array, add 2 logging statements to the body of the callback function:

console.log('The value of accumulator: ', accumulator);
console.log('The value of currentValue: ', currentValue);

Copy to Clipboard

Then, add a return statement that adds accumulator to currentValue.
Checkpoint 4 Passed

4.

Log the value of newSum to the console to see the return value of calling .reduce() on newNumbers.
Checkpoint 5 Passed

5.

While we have this code set up, let’s also check what happens if you add a second argument to .reduce(). The second argument acts as an initial value for the accumulator.

Add a second argument of 10 to .reduce().

solution;
const newNumbers = [1, 3, 5, 7];

const newSum=newNumbers.reduce((accumulator,currentValue)=>{
      console.log('The value of accumulator: ', accumulator);
    console.log('The value of currentValue: ', currentValue);
    return accumulator+currentValue;
},10)
console.log(newSum)
ouput;
The value of accumulator:  10
The value of currentValue:  1
The value of accumulator:  11
The value of currentValue:  3
The value of accumulator:  14
The value of currentValue:  5
The value of accumulator:  19
The value of currentValue:  7

some examples;
In the code editor, there is an array called words. We want to create a new array of interesting words. The first thing we want to do is check if there are words that are fewer than 6 characters long. There is something missing in the words.some() method call. Fix this method so that true is printed to the console.

For more information browse MDN’s documentation on .some() .
Checkpoint 2 Passed

2.

The .some() method returned true, which means there are some words in the array that are shorter than six characters. Use the .filter() method to save any words longer than 5 characters to a new variable called interestingWords, declared with const.

We’ve used .filter() in a previous exercise, but, for more information browse MDN’s documentation on .filter() .
Checkpoint 3 Passed

3.

In the last line of main.js, there is this code:

// console.log(interestingWords.every(word =>        ));

Copy to Clipboard

Complete the code between the parentheses to check if every element has more than 5 characters.

Make sure to uncomment (delete the // before) the last line of the program before you run the code. 

solution;
const words = ['unique', 'uncanny', 'pique', 'oxymoron', 'guise'];

// Something is missing in the method call below

console.log(words.some((word) => {
  return word.length < 6;
}));

// Use filter to create a new array
const interestingWords= words.filter(word=>{
  return word.length>5;
})


// Make sure to uncomment the code below and fix the incorrect code before running it

console.log(interestingWords.every((word) => {
return word.length>5; 



}));

output;
true
true

some example;
Replace the word method in the first method call with a method that will do something to each of the values in the array and return undefined.
Checkpoint 2 Passed

2.

In the second method call, replace the word method with a method that will return a new array with only those elements longer than 7 characters.
Checkpoint 3 Passed

3.

In the third method call, replace the word method with a method that accepts an array containing multiple values and returns a single value.
Checkpoint 4 Passed

4.

In the fourth method call, replace the word method with a method that will return a new array of numbers returned from the function.
Checkpoint 5 Passed

5.

In the fifth method call, replace the word method with a method that will return a boolean value.


solution;
const cities = ['Orlando', 'Dubai', 'Edinburgh', 'Chennai', 'Accra', 'Denver', 'Eskisehir', 'Medellin', 'Yokohama'];

const nums = [1, 50, 75, 200, 350, 525, 1000];

//  Choose a method that will return undefined
cities.forEach(city => console.log('Have you visited ' + city + '?'));

// Choose a method that will return a new array
const longCities = cities.filter(city => city.length > 7);

// Choose a method that will return a single value
const word = cities.reduce((acc, currVal) => {
  return acc + currVal[0]
}, "C");

console.log(word)

// Choose a method that will return a new array
const smallerNums = nums.map(num => num - 5);

// Choose a method that will return a boolean value
nums.every(num => num < 0); 

output;

Have you visited Orlando?
Have you visited Dubai?
Have you visited Edinburgh?
Have you visited Chennai?
Have you visited Accra?
Have you visited Denver?
Have you visited Eskisehir?
Have you visited Medellin?
Have you visited Yokohama?
