there are 4 many operatores into js
1. Arithmatic ; +,-,%,- 
2. we use + to concatenate two words to form a string
3. string.length =-> show you the number of characters into that string
4. use string.Trim() to remove any whitespace around the string
5. use string.toUpperCase to make string in Uppercase 

some built in functions;
1. Math.random() ==> generate a random num
2.Math.floor()  -> generate the number that is  greater or equal to the current number
Math.ceil() -> generate the number that is  less than or equal to the current number 
Number.Isinteger (number to compare with) -> check whether number is integer or not if yes return True else no
